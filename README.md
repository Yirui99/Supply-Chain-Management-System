Background
The supply chain industry is a cross-domain management system that covers the entire process from raw material procurement to final product delivery to consumers. With the deepening of global economic integration and continuous technological progress, the importance of the supply chain industry is becoming increasingly prominent, and its development trend is also constantly changing and evolving. However, in the process of the development of the supply chain industry, the following problems have emerged: inventory management challenges, data opacity, multi-level management, difficulty in management, and increased risk of data breaches.
Project Overview:
This project aims to solve many problems in the perishable supply chain by building an intelligent supply chain database system. By optimizing inventory management, improving transportation transparency, and enhancing the collaborative capabilities of all parties, we not only hope to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction, but also contribute to sustainable development and environmental protection goals. In the future, as the system continues to improve and data continues to accumulate, we will continue to improve the system's intelligence and service capabilities to provide more efficient and intelligent supply chain management solutions for more companies.
Mission Objectives:
Waste reduction and sustainability: 
We will analyze the data from our database to optimize the inventory to minimize any food waste and improve the energy consumption in the business organization, which leads to sustainability goals.
Improve operational efficiency and reduce waste:
Through analysis and optimization of inventory data, we can significantly reduce waste during the storage of perishable goods, thereby reducing operating costs.
Optimized inventory management and supply chain coordination will improve product turnover and sales efficiency, and improve overall operational efficiency.
Achieve sustainable development goals:
Through accurate demand forecasting and inventory optimization, unnecessary energy consumption and resource waste can be reduced, helping companies achieve their sustainability goals and reduce their carbon footprint.


Supplier and retailer coordination: 
A data driven platform will facilitate an easy data exchange and communication between the supplier, transporters and the retailers, which leads to better coordination and maintenance of deliveries and the inventory.
	Enhance supply chain transparency and collaboration:
A data-driven supply chain platform will enable efficient data sharing and communication between suppliers,and retailers, improving transparency and collaboration efficiency at all links in the supply chain.


Better inventory control and management: 
A database will optimize maintenance of the stock level, product shelf life and ensure optimal storage conditions for the product.
	Enhanced inventory control and management:
The system will improve product shelf life management through refined inventory management, ensuring that products are stored in optimal conditions and reducing the risk of expiration and damage.
Support for business scale expansion:
The system is highly scalable and can flexibly adapt to the needs of businesses of different sizes, supporting their expansion and development in the market.

Scope
The Supply Chain Management System for Perishable Goods will focus on making the supply chain more open, improving tracking of shipments, and better managing stockpiles. It will give information on stock levels, keep track of things as they travel, keep an eye on rules that don't hurt the environment (like temperature and humidity), and guess how much waste there will be. The method will connect wholesalers, carriers, and stores, which will improve cooperation and the ability to do the job well. With the ability to handle deals of all kinds, it will be able to connect to outside plans and keep data safe. It will also work to cut down on waste and energy use, which will result in smaller carbon footprints. The method will make it easier to keep track of inventory, make delivery more clear, and make it easier for everyone in the supply chain to work together. Its goals are to get rid of waste and give people the knowledge they need to make smarter decisions. Businesses will be able to reach their goals and move up because it can be grown and is built to last.
